                <P class="info__text">LAKE KOPA <br><br> is the natural lake in Akmola region, Kazakhstan, near the city of Kokshetau. It is one of the most important water body in the region and plays a significant ecological, and cultural role of the region.The lake's surface area is 14 km²,The lake's depth ranges from 2 to 3 meters. The water table is 223.8 meters above sea level. Lake Kopa ,with the nearest hills create an unique landscape which is important place in Kokshetau.<br><br>The Kylshakty and Shagalaly Rivers flow into the lake, and springs also bubble up from the bottom, feeding it. The lake is a flowing body of water and does not dry out in summer. The lake's dimensions are 5.4 km along its longest side and 3.3 km wide. The amplitude of water fluctuations in the lake is 0.5–1.5 m. The lake belongs to the Ishim water management basin and is part of the Kokshetau group of lakes.</p>

            <p class="problems__text">The research revealed that human activity has a significant impact on water quality in Lake Kopa and its inflowing rivers. High visitor traffic, nearby settlements, and infrastructure contribute to increased levels of dissolved substances, leading to pollution. Even remote areas showed signs of contamination, indicating that pollutants can spread through the water system and affect larger areas over time.</p>

            <p class="solutions__text">To improve water quality in Lake Kopa, several measures can be implemented. Cleaning plastic waste, limiting recreational pressure, installing water treatment facilities, and starting bioremediation can help reduce pollution. With these actions, TDS could stabilize at 400–500 ppm within a few years, species diversity could recover, and ecotourism could develop. Over time, these efforts could lower TDS to 300–400 ppm and create a self-sustaining ecosystem, preventing further degradation and the risk of the lake turning into a swamp.</p>
